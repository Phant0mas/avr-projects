#AVR Projects

I got quite a few parts laying around, so it's a good time to start
writing some code for them.

All the source code will be in C. I will just write small examples
for each part I have. I hope this repo ends up being a good place
for anyone interested in AVR hacking.

##Tools I am using

1) avr-gcc:  4.9.2
2) avr-libc: 1.8.1-1
3) avrdude:  6.1
